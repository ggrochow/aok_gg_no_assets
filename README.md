# [aok-gg](https://aok-gg.vercel.app)

## This version of aok_gg does not include any image assets from the game and will probably not work running locally

Although the devs of the game were cool with the site existing, I dont think I should be sharing them on GH.

If you want to run this, you will have to figure out how to get spell/class/item icons from the game files and place them into the public/(spell_icons | class_icons | item_icons) folders with the right names. Good luck :)
