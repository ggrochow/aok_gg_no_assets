# [aok-gg](https://aok-gg.vercel.app)
## This version of aok_gg does not include any image assets from the game and will probably not work running locally
Although the devs of the game were cool with the site existing, I dont think I should be sharing them on GH.

If you want to run this, you will have to figure out how to get spell/class/item icons from the game files and place them into the public/(spell_icons | class_icons | item_icons) folders with the right names. Good luck :)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
